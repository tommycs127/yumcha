A phonology-oriented romanization engine for Cantonese and other languages.

> "Yumcha" is a play on Cantonese words. While it traditionally means "drinking tea" (<ruby>飲<rt>jam2</rt>茶<rt>caa4</rt>), it also sounds like a "phonological lookup" (<ruby>音<rt>jam1</rt>查<rt>caa4</rt>).
> Just as tea brings people together, this engine aims to bridge different romanization and phonetic schemes!

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This project is in its **early stages** and undergoing active development. The API and functionality are **highly unstable** and subject to breaking changes without notice. **Do not use this in production environments.**

## ✨ Highlights

- **Scheme-to-Scheme Conversion**: Convert seamlessly between different romanization and phonetic schemes within the same language.
- **Scheme Parsing**: Parse strings to identify their phonological components and their IPA representations.
- **Syllable Set Generation**: Get all valid syllables of a scheme.
- **Zero Third-Party Dependencies:** Lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.
- **Type-hinted**: Built with modern Python 3.12+ type hints for better IDE support and readability.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Add new schemes by simply defining the representation structure, validation rules, and an IPA-to-symbol map!

## 🤔 Why Yumcha?

Sinitic romanization is fragmented and converting between systems often requires large handwritten mapping tables, which break down for edge cases such as unusual spellings and tone markings.

Yumcha provides a unified API to convert these schemes without requiring the user to write complex mapping logic or maintaining large mapping tables that can miss edge cases.

## ⚙️ How it works

Yumcha first parses text into an intermediate phonological representation that explicitly identifies components such as the **initial**, **medial**, **nucleus**, **coda**, and **tone**.

Once the syllable is organized into this structured form, it can be mapped to its IPA representation and subsequently converted into any other supported romanization or phonetic scheme.

## 📋 Requirements

Python 3.12 or above.

## 📦 Installation

Install Yumcha using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tommycs127/yumcha.git
```

## 🚀 Usage

Import the `Yumcha` class from `yumcha` and initialize it with `Language` classes:

```py
from yumcha import Yumcha

# Use the bundled languages provided by the library...
from yumcha.languages import Cantonese

# ...or define your own custom subclasses!
# from my_languages import MyLanguage

languages = [
    Cantonese(),
]

yumcha = Yumcha(languages)
```

### Check available schemes

```py
print(yumcha.menu)
```

Output:

```text
{'cantonese': ['ile', 'jyutping', 'kuping', 'kuping_alt', 'sidneylau', 'slwong_phonetic', 'slwong_roman', 'yale']}
```

### Conversion

Convert a Jyutping syllable to ILE:

```py
converted = y.convert(
    language_name="cantonese",
    from_scheme_name="jyutping",
    to_scheme_name="ile",
    text="seot1",
)
print(converted)  # soet7
```

### Parsing

#### Scheme representation

Parse a Yale syllable into components:

```py
parsed = yumcha.parse(
    language_name="cantonese",
    scheme_name="yale",
    text="chēun",
)
print(repr(parsed))
```

Output:

```text
YaleRepresentation(
    initial='ch',
    nucleus_before_tone='e',
    tone='̄',
    nucleus_after_tone='u',
    coda_vowel='',
    tone_h='',
    coda_consonant='n'
)
```

#### IPA from scheme representation

Parse a Yale syllable into components and retrieve its IPA representation:

```py
parsed_ipa = yumcha.parse_to_ipa(
    language_name="cantonese",
    scheme_name="yale",
    text="chēun",
)
print(repr(parsed_ipa))
```

Output:

```text
CantoneseIPARepresentation(
    initial='t͡sʰ',
    nucleus='ɵ',
    coda='n',
    tone='˥'
)
```

Please note that any subclass inheriting from the `Representation` class is **not** a `str` object. To get a string, simply wrap the object in `str()`:

```py
parsed_ipa_str = str(parsed_ipa)
print(parsed_ipa_str)  # t͡sʰɵn˥
```

### Getting all valid syllables

Get all valid syllables in the Sidney Lau scheme:

```py
all_syllables = yumcha.get_all_syllables(
    language_name="cantonese",
    scheme_name="sidneylau",
)
print(all_syllables)
```

Output (12,600 items):

```text
[SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='f', nucleus='aa', coda='', tone='1°'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='f', nucleus='aa', coda='', tone='1'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='f', nucleus='aa', coda='', tone='3'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='f', nucleus='aa', coda='', tone='2'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='f', nucleus='aa', coda='', tone='6'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='f', nucleus='aa', coda='', tone='4'),
 ...,
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='', nucleus='u', coda='ng', tone='1'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='', nucleus='u', coda='ng', tone='3'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='', nucleus='u', coda='ng', tone='2'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='', nucleus='u', coda='ng', tone='6'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='', nucleus='u', coda='ng', tone='4'),
 SidneyLauRepresentation(initial='', nucleus='u', coda='ng', tone='5')]
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This operation may take a few seconds to complete due to the volume of validated combinations generated.
> - The output list includes all theoretically valid syllables. While many are rare in common usage, they remain phonologically possible and pronounceable.
> - As validation rules and syllable constraints are updated during development, the total count may fluctuate.

## 🚫 Limitations

### No Tone Sandhi

Tone sandhi depends on linguistic context (e.g., phonological environment) and is therefore out of scope for this project.

### Limitations of Certain Schemes

#### Tone Information Loss during Conversion

Some schemes include specialized markers for different tone contours—such as the Sidney Lau scheme, which uses `1°` for the high-flat tone and `1` for the high-falling tone—Yumcha treats these as having the same tone register and name. Consequently, precise information regarding these tonal distinctions may be lost during the scheme-to-scheme conversion.

#### Unrepresentable Syllables

Some schemes are designed in a way that loses certain phonological distinctions.

For example, the S. L. Wong Romanization scheme uses `e` for `[ɛː]` and `u` for `[u̯]`, but it uses `eu` for `[yː]`. This prevents the scheme from being able to represent `[ɛːu̯]`. Therefore, converting an input such as `deu6` (in Jyutping) to the S. L. Wong scheme results in no valid output.

Such limitations must be explicitly defined in the `validate()` method of any subclass inheriting from the `Representation` class.
